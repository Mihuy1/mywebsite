    <h1>Patrik Hyyti√§inen Website Homepage</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome! This page has things I have studied and learned and some of my
      projects in adition to my Portfolio.
    </p>
    <p>Now you may ask why this simple design without much CSS?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Accessible:</b> Not everyone has high speed internet access. You
        won't find any clunky vidoes or advertisements.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Useful:</b> This website is not a personal sales channel.It contains
        things I have learned and projects I have done in adition to my
        Portfolio. I use this website to save my projects and studies in one
        place.
